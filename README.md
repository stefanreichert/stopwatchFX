# stopwatchFX
My son was asked in school to co-author a computer program with me - because I studied computer science. OK, so here we go with a JavaFX game that my son co-authored.

## code structure
You'll find a classic MVC pattern, where my son contributed the C.

## build & distribution
Build the project with Maven. The package phase will create a "target/stopwatchFX" folder & a ZIP file holding the executable created by jlink (javafx-jlink). I tested it only on MacOS which works.
